      <p><em><strong>To inhabit is to say here</strong></em> is a collective archive that explores what it means to inhabit when space becomes transitory, uncertain, barely a contour that sustains us. By introducing new places, you will be generating a map not only of personal trajectories, but also of different ways of inhabiting and remaining.</p>
      <p>The website proposes that inhabiting is not only a matter of physical space, but a practice that constitutes us as social subjects, making visible how the act of settling, acquiring objects, or simply occupying a place becomes part of our identity.</p>
      <p>Explore the map and see what other users have shared. Each point represents a space inhabited by someone: passage, trace, or settlement. Feel free to write, erase, remember, forget.</p>

            <p>Patterns of residential mobility in Europe demonstrate a notable contrast to those observed in other global regions. Comparative surveys across sixteen European countries suggest that an individual living in Europe will relocate approximately four times over the course of their lifetime. More localized studies indicate national variations: in the Netherlands, for instance, statistical data from 2021–2022 places the average closer to seven moves across a lifetime, highlighting how internal dynamics such as housing markets, rental cultures, and welfare systems can shape mobility differently within Europe.</p>
            <p>While Eurostat’s People on the Move (2020) situates contemporary European mobility largely in the context of cross-border migration, education, work, and tourism, it does not directly measure residential relocations; nonetheless, it confirms that such mobility is increasing in scope and significance. </p>
            <p>Demographic research further demonstrates that relocation is most frequent during early adulthood, particularly in the mid-to-late twenties, as individuals leave the parental household, pursue higher education, or respond to labor market opportunities. In later life stages, mobility tends to stabilize, reflecting both the accumulation of social ties and the constraints of property ownership or long-term tenancy.</p>
            <p>This project invites you to inscribe your own trajectory into this broader cartography. Each move — whether fleeting or enduring — carries memories of passage, trace, or settlement. By participating, you contribute to a collective archive that makes visible the ways in which we inhabit and re-inhabit space.</p>
